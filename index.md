# Workshop AI for Justice
# Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in War Crimes Archiving


Workshop will gather representatives of academia, civil society and expert communities interested in working with online and offline war crimes databases and archives. Workshop participants will familiarise themselves with the recent generative AI tools and learn how to apply them while implementing practical assignments with digital materials on core international crimes (i.e. genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and the crime of aggression). During the workshop, participants will be subdivided into groups, with each group working with a separate type of digital materials (texts, audio-visual materials, metadata, etc.). With the help of trainers and team leaders, groups will learn how to search for information in various multimedia documents, in different languages, with the purpose of facilitating information processing and increasing access of legal practitioners and civic activists to the linkage evidence, which connects alleged perpetrators to individual cases.

 

**Expected outcome:** Through individual tasks and teamwork in mixed interdisciplinary groups, the participants will network, share their professional experiences and build a small AI-aware community, which will further specialise in using Generative AI as well as continue training together to advance the effective systematisation, preservation, and presentation of war crimes archives. Because available open-source software provides many opportunities for international collaboration in a collective virtual environment, the community could expand and become a platform for sharing resources and training new community members. Participants will get access to code and tools they can use to make their own archives/databases searchable and accessible.

|**12:50**| **Practice part 1:** Retrieval Augmented Generation and chatbots<br>Goal: build a prototype to archive data, understand how it works and the limits. Reflect on the limitations.<br>Setting up a RAG system (with or without coding skills), step by step tutorial with participants. Application to different data, participants work on some data they chose. Open discussion about the possibilities and limits.|

|**14:40**| **Practice part 2:** AI for video, images and audio<br>Goal: get to know AI models which extract information from video, audio and images.<br>Practice with open-source models from Huggingface.co, WHISPER, CLIP and others, convert speech to text, image to text and produce video summaries. Application to different data, participants work on some data they chose. Open discussion about the possibilities and limits.|
|**16:00**| End of the first day|
