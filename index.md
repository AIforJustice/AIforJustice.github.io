|**12:30**| Retrieval Augmented Generation and chatbots, new paradigm for archiving and retrieving documents + short practice: chatbots<br>Daniel Kaiser|

|**12:50**| **Practice part 1:** Retrieval Augmented Generation and chatbots<br>
Goal: build a prototype to archive data, understand how it works and the limits. Reflect on the limitations.<br>
Activities: <ol>
<li>Setting up a RAG system (with or without coding skills), step by step tutorial with participants.</li>
<li>Application to different data, participants work on some data they chose.</li>
<li>Open discussion about the possibilities and limits.</li>
</ol>|

|**14:00**| The Role and Legal Framework of OSINT in the Collection and Analysis of Digital Evidence in the Ukrainian case<br>Kateryna Latysh, Marie Curie Fellow, Associate Professor the Department of Criminalistics, Yaroslav Mudryi National Law University; Senior Lecturer of Faculty of Law in Vilnius University (Lithuania)|
|**14:20**| *Coffee break*|

**14:40** **Practice part 2:** AI for video, images and audio

Goal: get to know AI models to extract information from video, audio and images.

Activities                                                
1. Practice with open-source models from Huggingface.co, WHISPER, CLIP and others, convert speech to text, image to text and produce video summaries.
2. Application to different data, participants work on some data they chose.
3. Open discussion about the possibilities and limits.

### Day 2 (Theory and Practice of Digital Archiving), 12 of June

|-----|------|
|**9:00**| MSCA Project ‘Hybrid Cyber Warfare and Common Security in Europe’, Open-Access Book on OSINT and digital investigation of core international crimes <br>Artem Galushko, Marie Curie Fellow, The Arctic University of Norway (UiT)|
|**9:20**| Managing databases and digital archives: challenges and opportunities in Ukraine (TBC)<br> Valentyna Soloviova, Analytical Department Manager, NGO Truth Hounds |
|**09:40**| *Coffee break*| 

**10:00** **Practice part 3:** Understanding the AI representation of data

Goal: understand how an AI model represents the data and organizes it. Understand the imperfect representation of AI models and the risks of relying too much on them.

Activities:
1. Tutorial on data visualization, t-SNE, UMAP, Graphs with Gephi and application to AI models.
2. Improving the RAG model, using what we have learned about AI model representations.

|**11:30**|*Lunch*|    

**12:30**   **Practice part 4:** Further developing AI for archiving: 
Open session for the participants' projects, combining the AI see in part 1,2 and 3.
Participants work on real-world archive data in teams, developing further a RAG system or some data analysis. The teaching team assists the teams in their projects.
