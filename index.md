# Workshop AI for Justice
# Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) in War Crimes Archiving


The workshop will gather representatives of academia, civil society and expert communities working with Artificial Intelligence and / or war crimes databases and archives. Workshop participants will learn about the recent advances in generative AI and the new possibilities offered by these AI tools for generating and extracting information from text, audio, images and videos. The workshop is the occasion to discuss the specificities of war crime related data and test AI models on these data.
 
During the workshop, participants will test AI models in practice helped by the teaching team from [Integreat](https://www.integreat.no/). Mixed group with participants from diverse backgrounds will work on applying AI to archive material (either online data, data provided by NGOs or their own data). Participants should have either 
* some programming background, 
* experience with databases,
* or a knowledge of or an interest in the process of war crime archiving and investigations.

 
**Expected outcome:** Through individual tasks and teamwork in mixed interdisciplinary groups, the participants will network, share their professional experiences and build a small AI-aware community. This community will specialise in using Generative AI to advance the effective systematisation, preservation, presentation and analysis of war crimes archives. Participants will get access to code and tools shown during the workshop and can use them to make their own archives/databases AI-enabled. The code will be available on the [AI for Justice Github repository](https://github.com/AIforJustice)

|**12:30**| Retrieval Augmented Generation and chatbots, new paradigm for archiving and retrieving documents<br>Daniel Kaiser|
|**12:50**| **Practice part 1:** Retrieval Augmented Generation and chatbots<br>Goal: build a prototype to archive data, understand how it works and the limits. Reflect on the limitations.<br>Setting up a RAG system (with or without coding skills), step by step tutorial with participants. Application to different data, participants work on some data they chose. Open discussion about the possibilities and limits.|

|**14:20**| *Coffee break*|
|**14:40**| **Practice part 2:** AI for video, images and audio<br>Goal: get to know AI models which extract information from video, audio and images.<br>Practice with open-source models from Huggingface.co, WHISPER, CLIP and others, convert speech to text, image to text and produce video summaries. Application to different data, participants work on some data they chose. Open discussion about the possibilities and limits.|
|**16:00**| End of the first day|

|-----|------|
|**9:00**| MSCA Project ‘Hybrid Cyber Warfare and Common Security in Europe’, Open-Access Book on OSINT and digital investigation of core international crimes <br>Artem Galushko, Marie Curie Fellow, The Arctic University of Norway (UiT)|
|**9:20**| Managing databases and digital archives: challenges and opportunities in Ukraine (TBC)<br> Valentyna Soloviova, Analytical Department Manager, NGO Truth Hounds |
|**09:40**| *Coffee break*| 
|**10:00**| **Practice part 3:** Understanding the AI representation of data<br>Goal: understand how an AI model represents the data and organizes it. Understand the imperfect representation of AI models and the risks of relying too much on them.<br>Activities:<br>Tutorial on data visualization, t-SNE, UMAP, Graphs with Gephi and application to AI models.<br>Improving the RAG model, using what we have learned about AI model representations.|
